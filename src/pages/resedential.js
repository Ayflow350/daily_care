Our Community Development Services program (CDS) provides individualized service supports for program participants to be involved in integrated community settings. We provide CDS in a variety of settings in the community to support the individual’s growth and development of skills and social supports necessary to gain, retain, or advance competitive integrated employment opportunities.

This program, designed to train and enhance competencies needed to help the individuals we support to become independent and successful, allows individuals with intellectual and developmental disabilities to familiarize themselves with and accomplish basic community-based tasks. We develop an Individual Plan that focuses on the participant’s strengths, needs, goals, and desires, helping individuals become comfortably active in their community.
